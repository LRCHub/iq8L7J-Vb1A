Ceasing the revolution
Returned to sedated serenity
A titanic fall from the throne of conquest
To the smallest particles of the organism
No longer flailing involuntarily from reflex
An unexpected calm in the face of calamity
Soothed by this newfound perspective
Gently inhaling the fumes of convalescence
Adrenaline fading in the arms of submission
Transfixed on the colored plumes
Entranced in this chemical hypnosis
Catatonic, we spiral on a flume of viscera
Methodically wandering into the black

Kaleidoscopic visions replace ambition
Drones circling the epicenter of control
The beams of energy that feed their vessel
Fracture the earth as they project to the heavens
The terrain rippling with seismic activity
Mountains crumbling into the molten core
Still we fixate on the assimilation

The warmth of our bodies fueling the aggressor
Seduced by the simple compounds we require to exist
Sustained in perpetual anesthesia
Stewing in the odors of our medicated atmosphere
Further Intoxicated with every breath
Again seduced by this fiendish illusion
Still bound to imperfection
How grave our miscalculation
